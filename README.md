This project is about exploring modern browser technologies (and stuffing all assets in one file)  
If you came here with IE or Edge you are out of luck. Use the latest Chrome or Firefox

## The **single file** [playingcardts.element.js](https://github.com/card-ts/playingcardts/blob/master/playingcardts.element.js) in this project contains:

* W3C Custom Element: ``<card-t> </card-t>``

* SVG data for 52 playing cards - **500 KB** painstakingly slimmed to **148 KB**

* Total filesize: **160 KB / 63 KB GZip**

# 63 KB creates 52 SVG playingcardts!

# Why another SVG playing card

I created a 'Hello World!' App with Framework X and the bundle was  **95 KiloBytes** ... to display 12 characters.

Where have the good times gone?
When we played adventure games on a [TRS-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80) with only **16** KiloBytes of memory

I learned to [PEEK and POKE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEEK_and_POKE) at the age of 10, and learned HTML (yes, a bit late) at **25**  
I liked WWW simplicity and the ability to 'peek at' and learn from someone else's effort.  
25 years later 'Web Development' has become *For-Rocket-Scientists-Only*  

**What happened to the days when all you needed were some HTML tags and a text-editor?**

[W3C standard Custom Elements](https://www.dannymoerkerke.com/blog/web-components-will-replace-your-frontend-framework)¬π make writing symantic HTML as cool as it was in 1994 .. **without any Framework !!!**  
playingcard(t)s are the perfect example to demonstrate the power of Custom Elements.

Feel free to PEEK around, and if you want to POKE make it an [issue](https://github.com/card-ts/playingcardts/issues/new).

# How the ``<card-t>`` Custom-Element works

For an introduction to W3C standard Custom Elements/WebComponents [read the excellent Blog by Danny Moerkerke](https://www.dannymoerkerke.com/blog/web-components-will-replace-your-frontend-framework)

Like the HTML5 ``<video>`` tag, the Custom Element ``<card-t>`` abstracts complex functionality into one HTML tag (customizable with attributes)

üìë Custom Elements must be declared in a Namespace, so require a - hyphen in the tagname üìë

## The minimal HTML file to display a Queen of Hearts is:

```html
  <html>
    <head>
        <script src='playingcardts.element.js'></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <card-t rank=Queen suit=Hearts></card-t>
    </body>
  </html>
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/mfhk2pd.jpg)

``<card-t>`` creates an image with the SVG as ``data:image`` src.   
Saves you from head-aches with SVG in a document (duplicate symbol ids, bleeding CSS etc.) and makes it easy to add HTML Drag-Drop functionality.

![](https://i.imgur.com/7csZylT.jpg)

üí° Drag a card to your desktop to see the created SVG 

Since ``<card-t>`` only creates a single IMG **no shadow-DOM is used**, thus IMG can be styled with **global CSS**.

```css
    [rank="queen"] img {
       border: 3px solid greenyellow;
       transform: rotate(15deg);
    }
```

# I am working towards a Solitaire game

This Custom Element ``playingcardts.element.js`` takes care of the 52 playingcardts.

Next challenge is to capture Solitaire game logic:

```html
  <cardts-game>
    <cardts-deck type="frenchdeck"></cardts-deck>
    <cardts-pile>
      <% 7 times %>
        <cardts-pile type="sequence"></cardts-pile>
      <%%>
    </cardts-pile>
    <cardts-pile id="foundation" type="stack">
      <% 4 times %>
        <cardts-pile></cardts-pile>
      <%%>
    </cardts-pile>
  <cardts-game>
```

## or even weirder ``<card-t>`` games ...

What if cardts could:

* change suit during a game
* fade out during a game
* change from Queens to Kings
* ...
* ...

# ``<card-t>`` attribute syntax

> playingcardts Terminology:  
* 'court' is UK english for 'face' US english. So Jack, Queen and King are **court**-cards (courts)
* SHDC is short for Spades-Hearts-Diamonds-Clubs 

``<card-t>`` takes a sh*tload of attributes you can play with:

* ``letters`` - Custom localized suit letters 
* ``courts`` - mix court images
* ``suits`` - Mix suit/court images
* ``suitcolor`` - Change SHDC suit color
* ``cardcolor`` - card color
* ``opacity`` - set card content opacity
* ``courtcolors`` - Change court image colors
* ``bordercolor`` - set card border color
* ``borderradius`` - set card border radius
* ``borderline`` - set card border line thickness

# üîß ``letters`` - Custom localized suit letters 

default: AJQK 

Rename Ace, Jack, Queen, King letters AJQK to Dutch locale 'Aas Boer Vrouw Heer'

````HTML
    <card-t suit=Spades   rank=Ace   letters=ABVH></card-t>
    <card-t suit=Hearts   rank=Jack  letters=ABVH></card-t>
    <card-t suit=Diamonds rank=Queen letters=ABVH></card-t>
    <card-t suit=Clubs    rank=King  letters=ABVH></card-t>
````

![](https://i.imgur.com/y83wjG8.jpg)

notes: 

  * a 4 letter string is used so it can be a global setting for all created cards

  * Custom ``letters`` draw **all** suits in Arial font

  * ``letters`` can not be Emoji (unicode strings)

# üîß ``courts`` - mix court images

default: 012

Rearrange SHDC court images to KJQ:

````html
    <card-t suit=Hearts   rank=Jack  courts=201></card-t>
    <card-t suit=Spades   rank=Queen courts=201></card-t>
    <card-t suit=Diamonds rank=King  courts=201></card-t>
````

![](https://i.imgur.com/sw8hWDi.jpg)

# üîß ``suits`` - Mix suit/court images

default: 0123

Change Spades=0, Hearts=1, Diamonds=2 , Clubs=3 court image:

````HTML
    <card-t suit=S rank=Queen suits=0000></card-t>
    <card-t suit=H rank=Queen suits=0000></card-t>
    <card-t suit=D rank=Queen suits=0000></card-t>
    <card-t suit=C rank=Queen suits=0000></card-t>
````

Uses Spades court images for all 4 suits

Yes, that 148 KB of SVG data could be reduced to 25%  (it is not in this element!)

Who will notice all cards use the same court image?

![](https://i.imgur.com/D9qFMP5.jpg)

# üîß ``backcolor`` - card backside color

default: #E55 (red)

````html
    <card-t rank=0 backcolor="red"  ></card-t>
    <card-t rank=0 backcolor="green"></card-t>
    <card-t rank=0 backcolor="#44F" ></card-t>
````

![](https://i.imgur.com/H6G1G7v.jpg)

# üîß ``suitcolor`` - Change SHDC suit color

default: #000,red,red,#000

# üîß ``cardcolor`` - card color

default: #FFF

````html
    <card-t rank=1 suit=0 suitcolor="#FFF,#FFF,#FFF,red"   cardcolor="red"       ></card-t>
    <card-t rank=1 suit=1 suitcolor="#FFF,yellow,#FFF,red" cardcolor="green"     ></card-t>
    <card-t rank=1 suit=2 suitcolor="#FFF,#FFF,black,red"  cardcolor="dodgerblue"></card-t>
    <card-t rank=1 suit=3 suitcolor="#FFF,#FFF,#FFF,red"   cardcolor="yellow"    ></card-t>
````

Note: You need to specify all 4 colors even when only applying one suit

Since the string is converted to an array the above can be written as:

````html
    <card-t rank=1 suit=0 suitcolor="#FFF,"    cardcolor="red"       ></card-t>
    <card-t rank=1 suit=1 suitcolor=",yellow," cardcolor="green"     ></card-t>
    <card-t rank=1 suit=2 suitcolor=",,black," cardcolor="dodgerblue"></card-t>
    <card-t rank=1 suit=3 suitcolor=",,,red"   cardcolor="yellow"    ></card-t>
````

üí° non-color values will break the SVG suit display... So.. if you want a card without suits.. force an error :-)

![](https://i.imgur.com/uvGJKQX.jpg)

# üîß ``opacity`` - set card content opacity

default: 0.8 

üí° 0.8 makes the cards look not too sharp, and you can higlight card-ts by setting opacity to 1

````html
    <card-t rank=1 suit=0            ></card-t>
    <card-t rank=1 suit=1 opacity=.75></card-t>
    <card-t rank=1 suit=2 opacity=.5 ></card-t>
    <card-t rank=1 suit=3 opacity=.1 ></card-t>
````

Note: CSS opacity makes the whole IMG transparent, ``<card-t opacity=.5>`` leaves the card **backcolor** at 100%

![](https://i.imgur.com/eZhAuob.jpg)

# üîß ``bordercolor`` - set card border color

default: black

# üîß ``borderradius`` - set card border radius

default: 12

# üîß ``borderline`` - set card border line thickness

default: 1.5

````html
    <card-t rank=1  suit=0 bordercolor=red     borderradius=12   borderline=12></card-t>
    <card-t rank=4  suit=0 bordercolor=hotpink borderradius=100% borderline=20></card-t>
    <card-t rank=13 suit=H bordercolor=gold    borderradius=12   borderline=38></card-t>
````

![](https://i.imgur.com/pdbp75j.jpg)

# ‚ò†Ô∏è ``courtcolors`` - Change court image colors

default: #DB3,red,#44F,#000,#000,4  (gold,red,blue,black,blacklines,linethickness)

````
    <card-t suit=Hearts   rank=Jack  courtcolors=gold,red,blue,black,black,4               ></card-t>
    <card-t suit=Spades   rank=Queen courtcolors=#DB3,lightcoral,lightblue,slategray,#000,1></card-t>
    <card-t suit=Diamonds rank=King  courtcolors=gold,red,green,orange,#000,4              ></card-t>
````

Note: suit decorations are set by the ``suitcolor`` attribute

# How I reduced 500 KB SVG to 148 KB

All good open-source SVG playingcards available are high-precision ready for print. 

* I started with the 550 KB for 52 CC-0 licensed cards from the [card generator by Adrian Kennard](https://www.me.uk/cards/)
* reduced precision with: [Jake Archibalds GUI for SVGO](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)
* manually reduced details in the cards you don't see on a computer screen
* cut everything up in separate SVG paths
* made redudant paths into single JS functions
* the SVG data is now 148 KB , this can be made smaller with some more elbow grease using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
* wrote a ``SVGcardt()`` function to create an IMG with SVG data

### A note on data compression

Using an [LZMA compressor](http://lzma-js.github.io/LZMA-JS/demos/advanced_demo.html) that **148** KB can be reduced to **55 KB**  
You then need to transport it over HTTP as Base64 making it 67 KB  
And the Browser needs to decompress the data which takes a hefty 200ms

Version 1 did de-compression and lazy loaded all 12 court images.

Since GZip is a similar compression (over the whole file)  
there is only a gain on really slow 3G connections (download takes 5 instead of 6 seconds)

# Frequently Asked Questions

### üÉè Why ``<card-t>``

A Custom Element requires its own namespace, so you are stuck to something with a - hyphen.

You can create 52 Custom Elements (extended from ``<card-t>``):

````html
  <queen-of-hearts></queen-of-hearts>
  <ten-of-spades></ten-of-spades>
  ...
````

But there is little value as you can not use **partial** Selectors for tagnames.  
To select all Spades you still need attributes:

````html
  <queen-of-hearts hearts></queen-of-hearts>
  <ten-of-spades spades></ten-of-spades>
  ...
````

### üÉè How about separating Element and SVG data?

Yes, an option is to exclude the (compressed/raw) SVG data from the Element file.  
The Element can then fetch the data asynchronous.

This project was about stuffing everything into **one** file.

### üÉè Where is the NPM installer?  

If you need an installer to copy **one** file: [playingcardts.element.js](https://github.com/card-ts/playingcardts/blob/master/playingcardts.element.js)  
You might find a better career flipping burgers at McDonalds.

### üÉè Where is the ``SVGcardt()`` source?

The ``<card-t>`` Custom Element declaration in [playingcardts.element.js](https://github.com/card-ts/playingcardts/blob/master/playingcardts.element.js) is Open Source.  
You can rename ``<card-t>`` to anything you want and customize the Custom Element to your liking.

The SVG creation code took some blood sweath and tears and is closed source for now. 

**You do NOT need the ``SVGcardt()`` _Source Code_ to use ``<card-t>`` in applications**

# Challenge - built your own game using ``<card-t>`` and your own Custom Elements

Create FreeCell with HTML Custom Elements

        <cardts-pile max=1></cardts-pile>
      <%%>
    </cardts-pile>
    <cardts-pile id="foundation" type="stack">
      <% 4 times %>
        <cardts-pile></cardts-pile>
      <%%>
